# Snake Using Windows
This is a game made out of multiple app windows. What that means is that the game makes multiple copies of itself and moves/stretches these app windows to make Snake!

This was made for Ludum Dare 49.

The theme of the jam was "Unstable" , so I decided to make a program that was itself unstable.

By the way, this was my first game jam. It was fun!
